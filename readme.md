Chinese Chess reinforcement learning by [AlphaGo Zero](https://deepmind.com/blog/alphago-zero-learning-scratch/) methods.

This project is modified from two projects:
1) https://github.com/Zeta36/chess-alpha-zero.git
2) https://github.com/timebug/harmless.git 
And I attached their original version as ZIPs in the root folder.

Note: This project is still under construction!!
The <b>new-threads</b> branch reconstrusted the original multi-threading logic and increased the performance reliably
